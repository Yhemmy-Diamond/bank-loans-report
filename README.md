### Project Description
The project involves developing an interactive dashboard to track, measure, and analyze loan operations. It provides insights into loan applications, funded amounts, and repayment statuses. The dashboard categorizes loans into “Good Loans” and “Bad Loans” based on repayment behavior and highlights key metrics such as the total funded amount, loan applications, and interest rates.\

The objective is to assist financial institutions in making data-driven decisions, identifying growth opportunities, and improving loan management efficiency. The visualized data facilitates stakeholder understanding of loan performance trends over time and across borrower segments.

### Technologies Used:
- Excel: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Power Query: For data transformation and preparation.
- Pivot Tables and Charts: To summarize key metrics dynamically.
- Advanced Excel Formulas: For calculating KPIs like MoM growth, DTI, and averages.
### NORTH STAR METRIC
Total Funded Amount Received: $473.1M.\
This reflects the bank's ability to fund and receive returns on its loans, indicating financial health.

### KPIs
- Good Loan Ratio: 86.2% (percentage of loans classified as good).
- Bad Loan Ratio: 13.8% (percentage of loans classified as bad).
- Total Loan Applications: 38.6K.
- Total Funded Amount: $435.8M.
- Interest Rates: Average interest rate per loan category (e.g., 11.6% for fully paid loans).
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Average DTI across loan types (e.g., 13.2% for fully paid loans).
- Loan Applications by State
- Loan Applications by Term
- Loan Applications by Employment Length


### Summary of Insights
The following are the insights gotten from the analysis: 
1. The majority of loans (86.2%) are classified as "Good Loans," contributing significantly to the total funded amount received ($435.8M).
2. A smaller portion (13.8%) are "Bad Loans," with a funded amount of $65.5M, of which $37.3M has been received.
3. Loans with lower interest rates (11.6%) are predominantly fully paid, indicating a correlation between interest rates and repayment success.
4. The "Debt Consolidation" and "Credit Card" loan purposes likely dominate the portfolio (inferred from their prominence in typical dashboards).
5. Monitoring the DTI and optimizing the balance between interest rates and approval criteria could further improve loan recovery rates and minimize defaults.

### Recommendations
Based on the insights derived from the Bank Loan Report, here are actionable recommendations for the bank to enhance its performance, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce risks:

1. **Optimize Loan Products:**\
i. Adjust Loan Terms: Since the majority of borrowers prefer 36-month loans, the bank should offer more flexible repayment options for this term, such as lower interest rates or additional perks.\
ii. Tailor Loans to Employment Profiles:

- Applicants with over 10 years of employment are a significant group. Offering loyalty rewards, premium loan packages, or preferential interest rates for this category could boost retention.
- For borrowers with shorter employment tenures (1–2 years), implement stricter risk assessment measures and provide smaller loan amounts to reduce default risks.
2. **Target Key Loan Purposes:**\
i. Debt consolidation and credit card loans represent the largest portion of applications. Performance can be improved by offering counseling or tools to help borrowers manage their debts more effectively.\
ii. Promote niche loan categories by creating awareness campaigns about these loans (for categories such as Renewable energy, vacation) because this category have low application volume.
3. **Improve Risk Management:**\
i. Refine borrower risk profiles by using a combination of metrics (e.g., Debt-to-Income ratio, employment length, and loan purpose) to develop detailed borrower profiles and tailor risk mitigation strategies.\
ii. Analyze patterns in terms of loan purpose, state, or term length to identify common default risk factors.
